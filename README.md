### Title

employee-directory

### Description

This is a React App. As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information. An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name. Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. The user should be able to: * Sort the table by at least one category * Filter the users by at least one property.
